# becooq81's TIL (Today I Learned) 🐣

Welcome to my TIL (Today I Learned) repository! This is where I document my daily learnings and discoveries related to programming and algorithms. Whether it’s a new technique, a solved problem, or an insightful concept, you'll find it here. 🚀

## Contents 📚

- **Programming:** Notes, code snippets, and tips on various programming languages and tools. 💻
- **Algorithms:** Insights and implementations of different algorithms, including problem-solving strategies and optimizations. 🔍
- **System Architecture and Design:** Observations and designs related to system architecture, software engineering principles, and best practices. 🏗️

## Velog Posts 📝

I also share some of these learnings on my [Velog](https://velog.io/@becooq81/posts). Posts from Velog are periodically uploaded to this repository using GitHub Actions, ensuring that everything is synchronized and up-to-date. 🔄
